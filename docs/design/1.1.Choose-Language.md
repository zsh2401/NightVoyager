# Which language/tech should be selected for back-end programing?
Considering the beautiful design of C#, I have thought use it as this project's backend language. But when I think further, I realize that I should use Java/JVM language whose solution to the problem and the IDE&Editor's support for cross-platform better more than .NET.
## .NET Core plugin System is not good.
I had implenments a plugin/extension system in my other project which named [AutumnBox](https://github.com/zsh2401/AutumnBox),this system has some strange issues which caused by .NET Core&.NET Framework. Using java to implements plugin/extension system might be eaiser and stable(e.g [MinecraftForge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge), [Bukkit](https://github.com/Bukkit/Bukkit)) (I REALLY HOPE SO).
# About front-end programing?
I had used Webpack + React + TypeScript as more than two light-weight project's solution.This combination is easy to use, stable and faster than tranditional technologies.
